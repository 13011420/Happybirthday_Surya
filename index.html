					<p> On this day, 23 years ago, a very special person came into the world, and I'm beyond grateful for it now! Happy Birthday! I'm so happy that the universe brought us together and we found best friends in each other! Cheers to many more years of spending our birthdays together! </p>
					<p> You've grown so much in the last year. I saw you grow as one strong and resilient fellow in even there was so much difficulty. Here's to better days ahead of us. And I hope you'll always remember I'm your biggest cheerleader and my shoulders are there for you to lean on, always. </p>
					<p> Fun fact: Birthdays are good for you! Stats show that the more you have birthdays, the longer you live! And I think you're supposed to grow finer and wiser with age? That's okay, there's always a next year :P Jokes apart, just like fine wine, you're getting better with age. Thank you for always lending your ears for me, whenever I needed to rant about how miserable my life is. As a birthday gift, I'll refrain from complaining about my life, but only for 24 hours! Maybe because you're stuck with me. </p>
					<p> Anyways, wishing you loads of happiness on this day! This website has been built just for you from stratch with loads of love! I'm hoping that you'd like it! I love you <3 </p>

					<p> What are you waiting for? Go ahead and explore your birthday gift!</p>
